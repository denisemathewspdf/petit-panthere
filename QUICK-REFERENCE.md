# 🐆 Petit Panthère — Quick Reference Card

**For your phone — everything you need in one place**

## 30-Second Pitch

> "I'm building my own AI agent platform called Petit Panthère. It's privacy-first, extensible, and Claude-powered. Think of it as a personal Chief of Staff who manages tasks, schedules, and workflows autonomously. I wanted control over my AI stack and deeper understanding of agent systems, so I'm building it from scratch."

---

## The Stack (One Line Each)

- **Interface:** Slack (now) → Dashboard (later)
- **Backend:** FastAPI orchestration + security
- **Intelligence:** Claude Opus for reasoning
- **Tools:** Google Sheets, email, scheduler (extensible)
- **Memory:** SQLite + long-term context

---

## Why I Built This

1. **Control:** OpenClaw founder → OpenAI, need my own stack
2. **Learning:** Hands-on with agent architecture, APIs, backend
3. **Privacy:** My data, my rules, full transparency
4. **Customization:** Built exactly for my workflows

---

## Security Highlights

- **Sandboxed tools:** Isolated processes with resource limits
- **Explicit permissions:** User approves each tool's access
- **Confirmation prompts:** High-risk actions require approval
- **Audit logging:** Every action logged and queryable
- **Prompt injection defense:** Hardened system prompts

---

## Current Status

**Completed:**
- ✅ Architecture design (5 layers, modular)
- ✅ Security model (threat analysis, defenses)
- ✅ Development roadmap (6 phases mapped)
- ✅ Basic Slack bot (demonstrates agent loop)

**Next (Week 1):**
- Task management (Slack → Google Sheets)
- Memory persistence (SQLite)
- Scheduled check-ins (morning/evening)

**Vision (Month 3):**
- Dashboard UI
- 10+ tool integrations
- Autonomous workflows
- Voice interface

## Demo (If Bot Working)

1. Open Slack on phone
2. Message Petit Panthère: "Add task: follow up with team"
3. Bot responds with confirmation
4. "That's the agent loop: Slack → Claude → Response"
5. Show architecture docs (README.md on laptop)

## Key Questions & Answers

**"How's this different from Zapier?"**
> "Zapier connects apps. Petit Panthère understands context and reasons about your needs. It's intelligent, not just scripted."

**"Why not just use OpenClaw?"**
> "OpenClaw is great, but I wanted to own my stack and learn by building. Also gives me full control over security and customization."

**"What if Claude goes away?"**
> "The intelligence layer is swappable. I can use GPT, local models, or any LLM. No vendor lock-in."

**"Is this for sale?"**
> "Personal first, but might open-source if it works well. Right now focused on making it bulletproof for me."

## Conversation Starters

**At ETH Denver:**
> "Hey! I'm building an AI agent platform. Are you working with AI or agent systems?"

**At Blockchain Unmasked:**
> "I've been thinking about how agents could help with crypto forensics — autonomous monitoring and alerting. Interested?"

**If someone asks what you do:**
> "I'm in consulting now, but building an AI agent platform on the side. Want to hear about it?"

---

## Follow-Up

If they're interested:
1. Exchange contact
2. Ask their use case: "What would you use an agent for?"
3. Offer to connect later: "Happy to show updates in a few weeks"

For Blockchain Unmasked:
> "I can write up a design doc on agent systems for crypto forensics. Would that be useful?"

## File Locations (Show on Phone/Laptop)

- **Overview:** `README.md`
- **Architecture:** `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Security:** `SECURITY.md`
- **Roadmap:** `ROADMAP.md`
- **Demo guide:** `DENVER-DEMO.md`
- **Setup:** `SETUP.md`

---

## Remember

- You don't need a perfect demo — architecture alone shows systems thinking
- "I'm two weeks in" is impressive, not a disclaimer
- This shows initiative, learning, and execution
- You're building, not just using. That's the differentiator.
